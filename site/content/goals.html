<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
The goals of this website and accompanying material (e.g. code, slides,
etc.) are:
</p>

<ul id="goals">
  <li>
    <em>Broad Audience</em> - make this kind of material accessible to
    developers who have a primarily imperative, non-functional background.
    Many developers who have spent time writing object oriented code likely
    have this background.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Practical</em> - offer small but non-trivial code examples to
    support claims about thinking about code functionally and using
    algebraic properties to improve various aspects of your codebase.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Digestible</em> - the reader will not be required to have a
    background in algebra for the beginner articles and any prerequisite
    knowledge of algebra in non-beginner articles will be linked to
    or provided within the article. I only have an undergraduate degree
    in Mathematics so my discussion of abstract algebra in these articles
    will not be particularly formal, for the reason of making the content
    as digestible as possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Informal</em> - the style of writing here will be fairly informal.
    I may use slang words or pop culture references ocassionally. I may
    even include meme images as a form of light comic relief. My hope is
    that this content will not be too boring or dry to digest.
  </li>
</ul>
