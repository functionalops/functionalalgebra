title: Testing Algebraic Properties
summary: Introducing the reader to thinking in terms of properties and models. Contrasting this approach to case based testing.
---

<p>
Over the last twelve years I have been developing in a test-first or
test-driven way with different levels of commitment. :) However, it was only
in the last four years that I discovered property-based testing. And it
blew my socks off. I couldn't believe I was living in the dark ages for so
long with case based tests. It also transformed the way I think when I write
the code under test itself. Radically.
</p>

<p>
Let me illustrate an example of each testing method below.
</p>

<p>
Let us say we want to write a function that sorts a list of elements. It can
be any sorting algorithm as long as it is correct. In this comparison we
are concerned foremost with correctness not performance or certain kinds
or sizes of lists.
</p>

<h3>Case-based Testing Example</h3>

<p>
In the case-based testing method we would first think of the simplest case
to test first.
</p>

<pre><code class="erlang">
-include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").

test_sort_empty_list() ->
  ?assert([] =:= lists:sort([])).
</code></pre>

<p>
Then we might come up with a few other cases that come to mind.
</p>

<pre><code class="erlang">
-define(SORTED_MULTI_ELEMENT_LIST, [1,2]).
-define(UNSORTED_MULTI_ELEMENT_LIST, [2,1]).

test_single_element_list() ->
  ?assert([1] =:= lists:sort([1])).

test_unsorted_multi_element_list() ->
  ?assert(?SORTED_MULTI_ELEMENT_LIST =:= lists:sort(?UNSORTED_MULTI_ELEMENT_LIST)).

test_sorted_multi_element_list() ->
  ?assert(?SORTED_MULTI_ELEMENT_LIST =:= lists:sort(?SORTED_MULTI_ELEMENT_LIST)).
</code></pre>

<p>
I could keep going, but I think you get the idea here.
</p>

<h3>Property-based Testing Example</h3>

<p>
Now for the same code under test we can think about the algebraic properties
of the function to test for. To me this is a fundamental idea in functional
programming. So let's look at the algebra of sorting lists.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Sorting is idempotent. Yep. What does that mean? It means this
    <pre><code class="erlang">?assert(lists:sort(Unsorted) =:= lists:sort(lists:sort(Unsorted))).</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    The size of the resulting list is the same as the given list (for all
    lists). So we could write the following:
    <pre><code class="erlang">?assert(length(lists:sort(Unsorted)) =:= length(Unsorted)).</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Now the above code for this section is pseudo code. There are libraries in
Erlang that provide the ability to specify these are properties and be able
to generate lists in many more ways.
